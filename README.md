# Custom Path Component

A custom path component built in lwc because the ootb path is, shall we say, limited.

The base path component handles the rendering of the path, but the meat of the logic is within any specific
implementation of the path component. The opportunityPath is provided as an example of how one
might go about implementing a production level path component.
